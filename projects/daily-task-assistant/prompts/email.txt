Subject: Aligning on next steps for {title}

Hi {recipient},

I wanted to follow up on "{title}" under the {project} workstream. This is a {priority} priority item with a due date of {due}.

Recommended next move:
- {next_step}

Let me know if you would like me to send this on your behalf or tweak any of the wording.

Thanks,
Daily Task Assistant
