Even working a full 12-hour day, that's less than 15 minutes per task. Let's break this down:\n\n---\n\n## Today's Reality Check\n\n| Metric | Count | Concern Level |\n|--------|-------|---------------|\n| Due Today | 50 | \ud83d\udd34 **Critical overload** |\n| Overdue | 4 | \ud83d\udfe1 Needs attention |\n| This Week (remaining) | 41 | \ud83d\udfe1 Heavy |\n| Urgent/Critical Today | ~7+ | \ud83d\udd34 Competing priorities |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What Actually Needs Your Attention TODAY\n\n### Must-Do (Urgent with real deadlines):\n1. **Pay Kensington HOA dues** - Financial, likely has a deadline penalty\n2. **Reach out to Zaphir family** - People are waiting, time-sensitive\n3. **Sabbath School Schedule** - Church commitment, others depending on you\n4. **Transfer Insurance escrow funds** - Already sequenced (#3)\n5. **Gather insurance escrow transfer details** - Prerequisite task (#2)\n\n### The Conflict Problem:\nYou have competing urgent tasks across **all three domains** (Personal, Church, Work) today.

I'd suggest:\n\n1. **Pick 5-7 tasks** that truly must happen today\n2. **Push 20-30 tasks** to next week with realistic spacing\n3. **Batch similar tasks** (e.g., all DATA feature work \u2192 one focused session)\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to help rebalance?** I can:\n- Spread today's overload across next week\n- Prioritize your top 5-7 for today and sequence them\n- Push all non-urgent Standard tasks to next week\n\nJust say the word and I'll make the updates.",
