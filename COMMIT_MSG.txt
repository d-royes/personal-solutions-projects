fix: Cascade delete and search for DATA Tasks

Fixes:
- Fix cascade delete: mark SS task as Cancelled+Done instead of deleting
- Fix Settings initialization in delete endpoint (was missing token)
- Skip syncing Cancelled tasks from SS to FS (prevents recreation)

Enhancements:
- Add search functionality to DATA Tasks filter
- Search across title, notes, project, status, priority
